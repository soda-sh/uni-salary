Work In Progress

# IMPORTANT

the commit #70f41a7 has a typo, it's not fixed

## convert script

now this script takes arguments

+ `-ui` for convert *.ui files to *.py
+ `-eol` for convert EOL char from unix (`<LF>`) to dos (`<LF><CR>`)
+ `no argument` does nothing, you need to specify at least one of the above

## TODO

### urgent

+ get path from `prompt` ui and store it into a variable
+ use `excel` wrapper for r/w from/to files

### not urgent

+ ui is not responsive
